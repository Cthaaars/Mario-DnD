### **Overview**

The Moon’s Shadow is a secretive cult operating in the shadows of the Sword Coast. Dedicated to summoning an ancient eldritch entity known as Nyx’Lura, the cult believes their dark god will corrupt the moon and bring about an era of eternal night. They are but a small cell of a larger, more insidious organization, though most members of the cult are unaware of this. The cult is slowly uncovering the forbidden rituals needed to free Nyx'Lura, with their main hideout hidden in the desolate expanse of the Lonely Moor.

### **Origin and History**

The Moon’s Shadow was founded by a group of scholars and occultists who unearthed ancient texts buried beneath the Lonely Moor. These texts spoke of Nyx’Lura, a god-like entity sealed within the moon by the gods of light. Obsessed with the idea of freeing this being, the scholars turned to forbidden rituals and dark magic, creating a secretive cult.

Over time, the cult grew in secrecy, recruiting lost souls and outcasts drawn to the promise of power and a new world order under the light of an eldritch moon. Most members believe they serve a divine purpose, unaware that their sect is merely a pawn of a greater and more sinister organization: _The Veil of Stars_.

### **Goals**

- **Corrupt the Moon**: The ultimate goal of the Moon’s Shadow is to summon Nyx’Lura by corrupting the moon. They believe this will plunge the world into eternal night, which they see as a purifying force that will remake the world in their god’s image.
- **Uncover Ancient Secrets**: The cult constantly searches for relics and texts that hold the key to unlocking the final ritual. They believe that the ruins beneath the Lonely Moor contain the knowledge needed to bring their god into the material plane.
- **Serve the Greater Purpose**: Though most cultists do not realize it, they are but one cog in a larger conspiracy orchestrated by the Veil of Stars. This greater organization manipulates various cults and secret groups across the Sword Coast, using them to further an even darker agenda.

### **The Lonely Moor Hideout**

The Moon’s Shadow operates from **The Hollow of the Crescent**, an underground labyrinth hidden beneath the Lonely Moor. The Moor is a desolate, windswept landscape dotted with bogs and rocky outcroppings, where few travelers dare to venture. The entrance to the cult’s hideout is hidden by natural rock formations and ancient, weather-worn stones covered in forgotten runes.

- **The Hollow of the Crescent**: This underground base was once part of an ancient, forgotten civilization whose ruins now serve as the cult’s home. Within the Hollow, the cult has repurposed old chambers for their dark rituals, carving crescent moon symbols into the walls and setting up altars made of black stone.
    - **Main Chamber**: At the heart of the Hollow is a vast chamber with a ceiling open to the night sky, allowing moonlight to pour in on certain nights. Here, the cult performs their most powerful rituals, using moonstones and enchanted relics to draw energy from the moon.
    - **The Labyrinth**: Leading up to the main chamber is a series of twisting tunnels and chambers filled with traps and ancient wards. The players will need to navigate these dangers as they delve deeper into the dungeon. Faint whispers and strange lights haunt the tunnels, a sign of the eldritch magic at work.
    - **The Elders’ Vault**: Deep in the Hollow lies the **Elders’ Vault**, an ancient repository of forgotten texts and relics. This area holds vital clues about Nyx’Lura, as well as references to the **Veil of Stars**. Here, the players can find fragments of dark rituals and cryptic hints that point to the existence of a much larger, more dangerous organization pulling the strings.

### **Leadership and Structure**

- **Lyra “The Nightseer” Falcoris**: Lyra is the current leader of the Moon’s Shadow in the Lonely Moor. Once a powerful druid, she was drawn to the cult after experiencing strange visions of the eclipsed moon and hearing whispers from Nyx’Lura. She now leads the cult with fervor, convinced that the world must be remade under the eldritch moon.
    
    - **Motivation**: Lyra believes that the world is sick with the light of the sun, and only the moon’s dark power can purify it. She is ruthless in her pursuit of this goal, using her druidic powers to manipulate nature and corrupt the land around the cult’s hideout.
- **The Eclipse Heralds**: Lyra is supported by a small but devoted group of elite followers known as the **Eclipse Heralds**. Each Herald commands a section of the Hollow and oversees a group of Acolytes. The Heralds are skilled in dark magic, particularly spells that manipulate shadows, nightmares, and the moon’s light.
    
- **Acolytes of the Crescent**: The rank-and-file members of the cult are known as **Acolytes of the Crescent**. Most are outcasts from society or lost wanderers who have been seduced by Lyra’s promises of a new world. They are the ones who carry out the cult’s menial tasks and serve as foot soldiers.
    

### **Rituals and Magic**

- **Ritual of the New Moon**: Every new moon, the cult performs a powerful ritual to weaken the magical bonds imprisoning Nyx’Lura within the moon. The ritual involves blood sacrifices and the chanting of ancient spells, which they believe drain the light from the moon itself.
    
- **Moonstones**: The cult uses enchanted stones known as **Moonstones** to focus their dark magic. These stones, when exposed to moonlight, glow with an eerie light and are believed to channel the will of Nyx’Lura. The players may find several of these Moonstones during their exploration, which could serve as magical items or clues.
    
- **Corrupting the Land**: Lyra and her followers use dark magic to corrupt the natural world around them. The Lonely Moor has slowly become more twisted and dangerous as their rituals sap the life from the land, leaving it barren and filled with unnatural creatures. Plants wither, animals grow aggressive, and strange phenomena—like unnatural fogs and ghostly lights—begin to appear.
    

### **Ties to the Greater Organization**

- **The Veil of Stars**: Unbeknownst to most members of the Moon’s Shadow, their cult is merely a pawn in the machinations of the **Veil of Stars**, a shadowy organization that seeks to manipulate various eldritch cults across the Sword Coast. The Veil has agents embedded in the Moon’s Shadow, feeding them false prophecies and rituals in order to further their own dark plans.
    
- **Clues to the Veil**: As the players explore the Hollow of the Crescent, they will begin to uncover strange, cryptic references to a larger power manipulating the cult. In the **Elders’ Vault**, they might find mentions of the **Veil of Stars** in old texts, or encounter a high-ranking cultist who hints at the existence of a greater force. This revelation will set up the next stage of the campaign, where the players will start to unravel the true scope of the threat.
    

### **Potential Plot Hooks**

- **Disappearing Villagers**: People from nearby villages have begun disappearing, and rumors of strange lights over the Lonely Moor have started to spread. The players may be hired to investigate, leading them into the desolate moor and eventually to the cult’s hidden base.
    
- **A Fallen Druid**: An old druid, once a mentor to one of the players, has come seeking help. She believes that Lyra, an old friend, has fallen to darkness, and she fears for the land’s future. She implores the players to find Lyra and stop her before it’s too late.
    
- **The Eclipsed Moon**: The players begin having strange dreams of a moon slowly being consumed by shadow. These dreams seem connected to the cult’s activities, and they may find clues about the Moon’s Shadow in ancient ruins or texts.
