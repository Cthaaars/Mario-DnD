### **Location Overview**:

In the dark depths of the [[Kryptgarden Forest]], near the player’s starting point, there’s a cave hidden by dense undergrowth known as the **Wailing Cave**. Locals say the cave is haunted by spirits, but it’s actually a small, remote cult hideout used to perform minor rituals and contact the larger groups without drawing attention. Only a handful of lower-ranking cult members operate here.

### **Cult Leader: First Acolyte Mara Thorne**:

Mara is a junior member of the cult, desperate to prove herself. She has limited magical ability but is fanatically devoted to the cause. She oversees this hideout, carrying out minor rituals in the name of Nyx’Lura.

- **Personality**: Desperate, fanatical, and easily flustered when plans go awry. Mara is driven by fear of failure.
- **Clue**: In the cave, players can find a **half-burned letter** from **Sariel** (the High Priest in Neverwinter), warning Mara to remain hidden but promising her a place in the "final gathering" when the time is right. This letter hints at **Neverwinter** as a location to explore next.
