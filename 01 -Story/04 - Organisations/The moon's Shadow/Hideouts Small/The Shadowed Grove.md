### **Location Overview**:

Located near [[Westwood]], a dense forest not far from Triboar, the **Shadowed Grove** is a hidden cult hideout used by low-ranking cultists. The grove is protected by thick, thorny bushes and enchanted to be nearly impossible to find by those who do not know the secret paths. This hideout serves as a relay point for cultists traveling to the **Blackspire** in Triboar, without drawing too much attention.

### **Cult Leader: Novice Tyriel "The Thorned Walker" Lyress**:

Tyriel is a young elf tasked with guarding the **Shadowed Grove** and ensuring its secrecy. He is fiercely loyal to the cult but inexperienced. Tyriel knows very little about the cult’s grander plans but maintains the grove as a place for members to rest and resupply while en route to more important locations.

- **Personality**: Cautious, nervous, and always worried about making mistakes. He’s eager to rise within the cult’s ranks but is too inexperienced to know the full scope of its operations.
- **Clue**: The players will find a **coded message** from **Selara** (the traitor in the Blackspire, Triboar), instructing Tyriel to stay hidden and prepare the grove for a potential influx of cult members. This message hints at the **Blackspire** as a significant location nearby, pushing players in that direction.
