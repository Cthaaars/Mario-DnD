### **Location Overview**:

In the winding streets of [[Baldur’s Gate]], there is a small, rundown building known as the **Whispering Brook**, which serves as a front for cult activity. Beneath the building is a network of old sewers and tunnels where the cult operates in secrecy. The hideout is primarily used to store smuggled goods and magical items for the cult’s larger operations.

### **Cult Leader: Eris "The Smuggler" Vosh**:

Eris is a smuggler and fence who fell in with the cult after seeing profit in their dealings. She now manages the cult’s underground operations in Baldur’s Gate, facilitating the movement of dark artifacts and magical items used in their rituals.

- **Personality**: Greedy and pragmatic. Eris cares more about gold than the cult’s grand plans, but she serves loyally as long as it benefits her.
- **Clue**: Eris keeps a **ledger of magical items** being sent to various cult locations, including **Elturel**. One entry references a shipment of dark artifacts needed for a "final ritual" in **The Lonely Moor**, but Eris doesn’t know the full significance.
