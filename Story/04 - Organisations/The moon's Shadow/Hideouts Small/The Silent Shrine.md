### **Location Overview**:

The **Silent Shrine** is a remote ruin deep within [[The Lurkwood]], an ancient, forgotten temple now serving as a cult safehouse. It’s used primarily as a meeting point for messengers traveling between hideouts and for cultists to regroup. The shrine is hidden within a large, dense thicket, protected by magical wards that dampen sound, making it difficult to detect.

### **Cult Leader: Brother Alric the Mute**:

Alric is a lower-ranking priest in the cult, known for taking a vow of silence. He uses subtle enchantment magic to maintain the wards around the shrine and communicate with other cult members without speaking. Alric’s role is to ensure the safe passage of messages between the various larger hideouts.

- **Personality**: Cold, stoic, and loyal to the cult. Alric is observant but not a fighter, preferring to use defensive spells and rely on his enchanted wards for protection.
- **Clue**: In Alric’s chambers, the players can find a **coded map** detailing a network of safehouses, including one in **The High Forest** (the Moonlit Hollow). Alric also carries a **crescent pendant** that seems to match symbols seen in other cult locations.
