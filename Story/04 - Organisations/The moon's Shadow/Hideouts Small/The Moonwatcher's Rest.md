### **Location Overview**:

Hidden within a seedy tavern in a rundown district of [[Waterdeep]], the **Moonwatcher's Rest** is a quiet, unassuming cult meeting point. The tavern is frequented by criminals, and the cult uses it as a base of operations for gathering information on city politics and manipulating powerful figures. The hideout is a safehouse for cultists passing through Waterdeep on their way to other major locations.

### **Cult Leader: Alaric "The Whisperer" Vance**:

Alaric is a former rogue turned cultist, using his connections to the criminal underworld to serve the cult’s goals. He has little magical ability but is skilled in subterfuge and espionage, making him an invaluable asset in Waterdeep.

- **Personality**: Sly, opportunistic, and always looking for ways to profit from his involvement with the cult. Alaric sees the cult’s goals as a means to gain power for himself.
- **Clue**: In Alaric’s quarters, players can find a **coded ledger** tracking the movements of cult members throughout the Sword Coast. It contains several references to **Silverymoon** and a meeting involving a "High Priestess Nyssara," hinting that Silverymoon holds a key hideout.
