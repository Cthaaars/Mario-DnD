### **Location Overview**:

Just outside [[Daggerford]], hidden within a dense thicket known as **Black Briar Hollow**, lies a small, makeshift hideout. This location serves as a temporary shelter for cultists traveling between larger hideouts. The hollow is surrounded by dangerous wildlife and protected by a ring of thorny briars that make it difficult to access.

### **Cult Leader: Garrik "The Thornkeeper" Aldryn**:

Garrik is a druid-turned-cultist who uses his knowledge of nature to keep the hideout hidden. He controls the briars and uses them as a natural defense against intruders. Garrikâ€™s role is mainly to provide sanctuary for cultists passing through Daggerford.

- **Personality**: Stoic and reclusive. Garrik is less interested in the grand schemes of the cult and more focused on protecting his small corner of the world.
- **Clue**: Garrik possesses a **letter from High Priest Caelric** (The Fallen Grovekeeper in the High Forest), referencing the **Moonlit Hollow** as a gathering place for higher-ranking cult members. This clue pushes the players toward the High Forest hideout.
