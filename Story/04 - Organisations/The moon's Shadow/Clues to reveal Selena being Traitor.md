ties to [[Hideouts#**Hideout 5 The Blackspire** ( Triboar ) – **Traitor Hideout**]]
### **Step 1: Suspicion Raised in Smaller Hideouts**

In the smaller hideouts, there should be early, subtle hints that suggest something is amiss within the cult, but nothing too concrete about Selara at this point. These clues should hint at the idea of internal conflict or sabotage within the organization.

#### **Clue 1: Shadowed Grove (Westwood)**

In **Tyriel Lyress's hideout**, the players find a coded letter from **Selara** instructing Tyriel to remain hidden and await further orders. The letter, however, contains a strange inconsistency when compared to other cult communications (perhaps a slightly different signature, wording, or an odd phrase). The players may not think much of it at first, but it’s the first subtle indication that Selara’s actions are unusual.

- **Clue Description**: A **coded letter** from Selara with cryptic instructions to stay hidden and avoid all unnecessary contact with other hideouts. Something about the wording could stand out—perhaps it’s unusually cautious or dismissive of standard cult protocols.

---

### **Step 2: Unusual Behavior Noted by Other Cultists**

As the players explore the mid-tier hideouts, they should encounter cultists who make passing remarks about Selara's strange behavior or inconsistent communication. This further builds suspicion but doesn't outright reveal her betrayal yet.

#### **Clue 2: Neverwinter Hideout (House of Eclipsed Light)**

In the **Neverwinter hideout**, the players discover a journal kept by **Sariel**, the High Priest of Neverwinter. It mentions frustration with Selara’s **delayed or unclear orders** and expresses concern that her actions may be jeopardizing the larger operation. Sariel doesn’t explicitly accuse Selara but expresses doubt and frustration. This is the second major breadcrumb that something is wrong.

- **Clue Description**: A journal entry from Sariel, noting that **"Selara's recent directives have been frustratingly unclear... She seems to be working to a different timeline, one I'm not aware of."**

---

### **Step 3: Hidden Communication**

In one of the larger hideouts, the players can uncover direct evidence of Selara’s betrayal, but it should still be something that only hints at treachery rather than an outright confession. This clue can involve hidden or secret communications between Selara and an unknown party outside of the cult.

#### **Clue 3: Mount Hotenow Hideout (The Molten Maw)**

The players discover a **hidden chamber** within the **Molten Maw** hideout. Inside, they find correspondence between Selara and an unknown outsider (perhaps a rival faction or group opposing the cult). This letter discusses sabotaging the cult’s efforts, though it’s not entirely clear what Selara’s motives are at this stage. However, her betrayal becomes obvious when the players find a **half-burned ritual parchment** that lists a series of failed cult operations with notes in Selara's handwriting that suggest intentional misdirection.

- **Clue Description**: A half-burned ritual parchment annotated by Selara, containing phrases like **"Delay shipment of artifacts to the Blackspire,"** and **"Ensure incorrect rune usage during the Moonlit Rite at the High Forest"** alongside letters to an unknown contact.

---

### **Step 4: Direct Witness Account or Intercepted Message**

This is the turning point where the players get direct confirmation of Selara's betrayal. This should occur in the later stages of the investigation, as they close in on the **Blackspire** in **Triboar**.

#### **Clue 4: Lurkwood Hideout (The Silent Shrine)**

In **Brother Alric’s hideout**, the players discover an **intercepted message** from Selara intended for another cult member. In this message, Selara openly discusses undermining cult operations in order to stop the Eldritch Moon ritual. If the players confront Alric, he may even confirm that he received **conflicting orders** from Selara at different points, hinting that her loyalties were never aligned with the cult.

- **Clue Description**: A secret message from Selara to another cultist or unknown party reads: **"The ritual cannot proceed. The moon must remain as it is—Nyx’Lura must not return. I’ll do what I can from within, but the others must not know."**

---

### **Step 5: Confrontation in the Blackspire (Triboar)**

Finally, the players confront Selara at the **Blackspire** in **Triboar**. By this point, they’ve likely pieced together the clues, but here they get the full story. Selara reveals her motivations for betraying the cult—perhaps she believes summoning Nyx’Lura would bring ruin to the world or has a personal vendetta against the leaders of the larger organization the cult is part of. This confrontation can either end in combat or negotiations, depending on how the players approach it.

### **Structure of Clues for Players to Uncover Selara’s Betrayal**

1. **First Signs of Inconsistency**:
    
    - Small clues from coded messages or odd instructions from Selara that seem out of line with the cult’s typical behavior (e.g., at the Shadowed Grove).

    - Journals or conversations revealing that higher-ranking cultists are frustrated or confused by Selara’s actions (e.g., Neverwinter hideout).
3. **Hidden Communication**:
    
    - More concrete evidence in the form of secret messages and intercepted letters that indicate Selara is working against the cult (e.g., Mount Hotenow hideout).
4. **Direct Evidence**:
    
    - Final proof in the form of intercepted or burned messages that clearly outline Selara’s plan to sabotage the cult’s activities (e.g., The Lurkwood).
5. **Confrontation in Triboar**:
    
    - The players confront Selara in the **Blackspire** hideout, where her betrayal is confirmed, and her motivations are revealed.

### **Optional Twists: Motivations and Outcomes**

- **Selara’s Motives**: The exact nature of her betrayal can vary depending on your campaign. Maybe she believes that summoning **Nyx’Lura** will destroy the world and views her actions as a way to prevent disaster. Alternatively, she could have a personal vendetta against one of the larger organization’s leaders, or she might be a double agent working for another secretive group.
    
- **Player Choices**: When the players finally confront Selara, they may have the choice to align with her if they agree that stopping the summoning is the best option, or they may view her as an enemy who needs to be stopped at all costs.
