Location: [[Silvermoon]]

### **Location Overview**:

In the beautiful city of **Silverymoon**, known for its magic and culture, the cult hides in plain sight. They operate out of a hidden underground sanctum beneath one of the city's noble estates. The cultists here use charm and illusion to recruit wealthy and influential individuals to their cause, under the guise of a secretive magical society.

### **High Priest: Andoras "The Silver Serpent" Voloris**:

Andoras is a former noble turned cult leader, who sees Nyxâ€™Lura as the key to a new world order. He operates from the shadows, using his wealth and connections to keep the cult hidden in Silverymoon. His greatest skill is manipulation, as he controls many pawns across the city without them even realizing it.

- **Personality**: Ambitious, cunning, and silver-tongued. Andoras always plans several steps ahead.
- **Clue**: Andoras keeps coded correspondence with other high-ranking cult members, referencing the "Hollow" and the "Eclipse Ritual." These letters will hint that the real heart of the cult is far from Silverymoon, buried deep in the **Lonely Moor**.
