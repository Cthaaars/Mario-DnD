Location:[[Elturel]]

### **Location Overview**:

Deep beneath the city of **Elturel**, in a long-forgotten crypt, lies a hideout known as the **Crypt of Wails**.

The crypt is haunted by restless spirits, many of whom serve the cult willingly.

### **High Priest: Damaris "The Soulbinder" Voreth**:

Damaris is a necromancer who believes that death is merely a transition, and that under the light of an eldritch moon, the living and dead will be united as one. She leads the cult in Elturel, commanding undead creatures and practicing forbidden necromantic arts. Damaris is obsessed with unlocking the mysteries of life, death, and rebirth under Nyx’Lura’s influence.

- **Personality**: Grim, morbid, and utterly dedicated to her study of death. Damaris sees herself as a harbinger of the future.
- **Clue**: Damaris’s writings detail the "Eclipse Ritual" needed to free Nyx’Lura. She also possesses a **Moonstone Talisman** linked to the main ritual site in the **Lonely Moor**, which players can use to access hidden chambers in the final dungeon.
