Location:[[Neverwinter]]

### **Location Overview**:

Located deep beneath **Neverwinter**, the **Crypt of Shadows** is hidden in the forgotten catacombs beneath the city. This hideout operates under the guise of an old, abandoned temple, with secret passages leading to deeper chambers. Cultists use illusions to conceal their movements and maintain secrecy in the busy urban setting.

### **High Priest: Sariel "The Veiled Oracle" Valtaris**:

Sariel is a half-elven sorceress with an affinity for shadow magic. She claims to be able to commune directly with Nyx’Lura through dark rituals. Sariel manipulates the minds of her followers, presenting herself as the cult’s most devoted seer, but her true power lies in illusion magic. Her hideout in Neverwinter serves as a place where the cult gathers information and influences powerful individuals in the city.

- **Personality**: Charismatic, manipulative, and coldly pragmatic. She uses her charm to bend others to her will.
- **Clue**: In Sariel’s chambers, the players will find a partial map hinting at a larger gathering of the cult in the **Lonely Moor**, but it's encoded. Additionally, she possesses a **Moonstone Amulet**, which will help them unlock hidden doors in later hideouts.
