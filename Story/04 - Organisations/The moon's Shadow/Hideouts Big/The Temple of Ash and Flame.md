Location: [[Mount Hotenow]]

### **Location Overview**:

This hideout is located in the volcanic caverns of **Mount Hotenow**, a dangerous and unstable region. The cultists here harness the primal energy of the volcano, believing it strengthens their connection to Nyx’Lura. The heat and lava flows create a hostile environment, and cultists perform fiery, destructive rituals to corrupt the land.

### **High Priest: Tharvun "The Burning Eye" Stonegrip**:

Tharvun, a dwarf once dedicated to the forge, turned to the cult after having visions of a moon consumed by fire. His right eye was burned out in a ritual to prove his loyalty, and he now leads the cultists in Mount Hotenow. Tharvun is a fanatic, obsessed with using the volcano’s power to fuel their dark magic.

- **Personality**: Zealous, aggressive, and intolerant of weakness. He believes in strength through fire and destruction.
- **Clue**: Tharvun’s journal contains references to a "great meeting of the faithful" in the **Lonely Moor**, as well as descriptions of an artifact known as the **Crescent Obsidian**, which is needed to perform the final summoning ritual.
