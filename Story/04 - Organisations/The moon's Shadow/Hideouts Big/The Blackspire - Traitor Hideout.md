Location: [[Triboar]]


### **Location Overview**:

Hidden in the outskirts of the bustling town of **Triboar**, the **Blackspire** is an old watchtower that the cult uses as a base for their operations in the northern regions of the Sword Coast. The tower is barely maintained, serving more as a meeting place and relay station for cult activity in the region.

### **High Priest: [[Selara "The Shattered Moon" Elandris**]] (Traitor)

Selara once believed deeply in the cult’s mission, but after discovering the truth about the **Veil of Stars** and their manipulation, she became disillusioned. She remains in her position but secretly seeks to undermine the cult. Selara knows that something far more dangerous than Nyx’Lura is at work, and she seeks a way to bring the organization down from within.

- **Personality**: Calm, calculating, and quietly rebellious. Selara plays her role but is looking for an opportunity to betray the cult.
- **Clue**: If the players uncover her secret, Selara will reveal crucial information about the **Lonely Moor** and the **Veil of Stars**, pointing them toward the cult’s true leaders. She may even offer to aid them in exchange for protection or a promise to bring down the greater organization.
