Location: [[The High Forest]]

### **Location Overview**:

Nestled deep within the ancient, mystical **High Forest**, the **Moonlit Hollow** is a druidic grove that has been twisted by the cult’s dark magic. The once-sacred trees are now sickened with shadow, and unnatural beasts roam the forest. This hideout is particularly dangerous, as the forest itself seems to work against intruders.

### **High Priest: Caelric "The Fallen Grovekeeper" Starleaf**:

Caelric was once a druid of the High Forest, but after experiencing dark visions, he became obsessed with the idea that the moon held a greater truth. He now leads the cult in the High Forest, corrupting nature to serve Nyx’Lura. Caelric believes the moon’s dark power is a force of nature that must be embraced.

- **Personality**: Somber, philosophical, and fanatically devoted to the moon’s cycles. He believes corruption is just nature evolving.
- **Clue**: Hidden within Caelric’s grove is an ancient stone tablet that contains part of the prophecy detailing Nyx’Lura’s release. It also mentions a "lost tomb" in the **Lonely Moor**.
